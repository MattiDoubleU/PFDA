# This is the repository for the weekly assignments for the Programming for Data Analytics module.
## Assignment description copied from the course page: https://vlegalwaymayo.atu.ie/course/view.php?id=10462#section-2

## Assignment 1:

Create a repository for this module, and upload a link to where you will put your handups.

You have a Choice of the format of your repositories, Either:

- One repository with three folders (assignments, mywork, project). Make sure you submit a link to the appropriate folder.
- Three separate repositories (PFDA-assignments, PFDA-mywork, PFDA-project). Make sure you submit a link to the appropriate repository
	
## Assignment 2 weather:

- Task 1: Commit something to your assignment repository this week (anything)

- Task 2: I have put a CSV file in a assignment folder in the PFDA-courseware repository

Create a jupyter notebook called assignment2-weather.ipynb that has a nice plot of the temperature over time 

( "dryBulbTemperature_Celsius" ). 

Marks will be give for:

- Completing the assignment
- How nice the plot looks

You may use PANDAS if you wish to read in the data

## Assignment 3 domains:

Create a notebook called assignment03-pie.ipynb

The note book should have a nice pie chart of peoples email domains in the csv file at the url

https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AWPf-pJodJKeHsARQK_RHiNsE8fjPCVK&export=download

This csv file has 1000 people. You may download the data or link to it.

Marks will be given for:

- Just creating the pie chart
- Making it look nice
- and as always a very small amount of marks will be given for just pushing something to your repository this week

As always your code should be well laid out.

If you are having difficulties, know I will be doing more on Pie charts later in this module.
