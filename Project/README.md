This is the project for the 2024 Programming for Data Analytics (PFDA) module. A description of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/PFDA-courseware/blob/main/labs/Project%20Description.pdf). 

Initially, I was going to do a project on aviation but struggled to find usable datasets that were free of charge. [Cirium.com](www.cirium.com), the world's most trusted source of aviation analytics for example provides top notch datasets, unfortunately none of them available for simple download. Same goes for [Iata](www.iata.org), International Air Transport Association or [CH-Aviation](https://www.ch-aviation.com), a subscription-based platform that provides accurate and reliable data and news on operators, aircraft, airports, and more. 

There are some aviation datasets available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) a brilliant platform for incipient data analysts but after all I decided to do the project on Irish weather data since we so often talk about the weather here in Ireland due to its erratic nature. As the saying goes: “If in the sky you see cliffs and towers, it won’t be long before there is a shower.”

Regarding the code I have mostly refered to the documentation of the libraries used in the project as well as code we covered in this module's as well as previous module's lecture:

London Weather Data From 1979 To 2023

Dataset Overview This dataset provides daily weather observations from Heathrow, United Kingdom (STAID: 1860), spanning the period from 1979 to 2023. The data is sourced from the European Climate Assessment & Dataset (ECA&D) and includes multiple weather parameters such as temperature, precipitation, sunshine, and more.
