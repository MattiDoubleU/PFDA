This is the project for the 2024 Programming for Data Analytics (PFDA) module. A description of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/PFDA-courseware/blob/main/labs/Project%20Description.pdf). 

Initially, I was going to do a project on aviation but struggled to find usable datasets that were free of charge. [Cirium.com](www.cirim.com), the world's most trusted source of aviation analytics for example provides top notch datasets, unfortunately none of them available for simple download. Same goes for [Iata](www.iata.org), International Air Transport Association or [CH-Aviation](https://www.ch-aviation.com), a subscription-based platform that provides accurate and reliable data and news on operators, aircraft, airports, and more. 

There are some aviation datasets available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) a brilliant platform for incipent data analysts but after all I decided to do the project on Irish weather data since we so often talk about the weather here in Ireland due to its erratic nature. As the saying goes: “If in the sky you see cliffs and towers, it won’t be long before there is a shower.”
